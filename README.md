# Hi! This is my playground for TypeScript!

### Everything's simple and there's not much styling (at least for now). Also the API calls are not done yet. I'm using mock-up data for now, since that's not the purpose of this playground.

_If you want to see more of how I use the mythical creature CSS or make cool API calls, please see the repository with the Brewery :)_

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
